A project to explore design patterns. Each pattern may contain module and usually a usage module would be present if there is auto-generate phase.

Note:
-----
This project may utilize other open source libraries to fit the gaps and acknowledges those authors for using it. 

Builder:
--------
Two modules builders and builders-usage to demonstrate auto-generation of interface for builder and a usage of generated interface to crate a proxy based fluent builder.
